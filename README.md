# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this project was to perform unsupervised machine learning techniques on a data set about cryptocurrencies. First, I preprocessed the data, then I reduced the dimesnions of the data using PCA. After that I clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-means and then visualized the cryptocurrency results.
